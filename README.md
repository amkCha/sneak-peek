# Sneak Peek

Sneak Peek is a platform that allows crypto-traders to reveal partial information about their investiments history. It relies on Zero Knowledge technology so users can securely prove some information about the history of their token holdings without having to disclose neither their Ethereum address nor the complete composition of their wallet.
  
In particular, it allows crypto-traders influencers to

- certify that their social media communication are aligned with their actual investment strategy
- provide their followers with partial information about their DeFi wallet composition and investment strategy

## Requirements

- 'docker'
